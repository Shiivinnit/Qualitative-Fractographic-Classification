# Qualitative-Fractographic-Classification
Qualitative Fratographic Classification of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images using Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML).

Classification of fractographic surfaces using SEM images is done through a pipeline where Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is leveraged to retrieve the textural information from the SEM images, and feature vectors constructed from the textural descriptors are then used to classify fracture surfaces into three categories: Ductile, Transgranular Brittle, Intergranular Brittle by a linear SVM classifier.
